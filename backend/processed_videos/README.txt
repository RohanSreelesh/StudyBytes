In a real application, this directory would contain the processed video files
generated by the AI processing system. For demonstration purposes, you should
place sample .mp4 files in this directory:

1. Copy sample mp4 files to this directory
2. Start the backend server
3. The files will be served at http://localhost:8000/videos/filename.mp4

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VIDEOS:
- Use videos with 3:4 or 4:5 aspect ratio for best results
- The UI is optimized for a slightly wider format than standard TikTok/Instagram Reels
- For demonstration, you can record vertically on your phone and transfer the videos here
- Or use sample vertical videos from stock footage sites

You can use sample videos from sources like:
- https://samplelib.com/sample-mp4.html
- https://sample-videos.com/
- https://mixkit.co/free-stock-video/ (has vertical videos)
- https://www.pexels.com/videos/ (search for "vertical" videos)

Example filenames:
- concept_explanation.mp4
- key_points.mp4
- problem_solving.mp4

These videos will be detected automatically by the backend and served to the frontend.

NAVIGATION FEATURES IN THE VIDEO PLAYER:
- Swipe up/down to navigate between videos
- Tap to play/pause
- Use the progress bar to seek
- Keyboard shortcuts: up/down arrows, space for play/pause
